In order to prevent mods accessing specific data the mod loader allows for fine grained control of each mods permissions. The permissions are defined in a `permissions.yaml` file. Lets look at the following example to understand the structure a bit better:

```yaml
mod-1: # name of the mod defined in its manifest.yaml
  database: # database section
    users: # users table inside the database
      read: true # only allow reading

mod-2: # name of the mod defined in its manifest.yaml
  database: # database section
    news: # news table inside the database
      write: true # allow writing / create / updating entries
      delete: true # allow to delete entries
```

In the example above we explicitly allow `mod-1` to read the `users` table from the database. As for the `mod-2`, we allow it to write and delete entry in the `news` table of the database.

## Permissions Overview

### Database Permissions

:::caution
All permissions are set to `false` by default to prevent unintended access.

For the different database tables and their use cases please refer to the SQL Deep Dive section.
:::

```yaml
database:
  [tablename]:
    read: false
    write: false
    delete: false
```
