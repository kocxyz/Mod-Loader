Here's how a [Knockout City](https://www.knockoutcity.com/) Mod is organized.

## Files and directories

- `assets/*` - Your mods assets (import files, ...)
- `defs/*` - Your mods sources (items, ...)
- <Link href='reference/metadata'>`metadata.yml`</Link> - A mod manifest

### Example Mod Contents

A common Mod Structure might look like this:

<FileTree>

- assets/
- defs/
  - items/
    - <Link href='reference/item'>custom-item-01.item</Link>
    - <Link href='reference/item'>custom-item-02.item</Link>
- <Link href='reference/metadata'>metadata.yml</Link>

</FileTree>

### `assets/`

The `assets/` directory is for files and assets that are referenced by source files.

### `defs/`

:::tip
This folder as well as deeply nested folders will get searched through.
Meaning you can structure your mod files however you prefer!
:::

The `defs/` folder is where almost all of your mods sources are located. This includes:

- <Link href='reference/item'>Items</Link>

### <Link href='reference/metadata'>`metadata.yml`</Link>

This file containes all neccessary information for mod loaders to load the mod successfully. Furthermore, it includes metadata information about the mod.
