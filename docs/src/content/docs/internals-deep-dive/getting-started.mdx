In this section we'll take a look at all the steps needed to start modding.

## Digging into the files

In order to start modding [Knockout City](https://www.knockoutcity.com/)
your should probably familiarize yourself with the files and see what exists. In
order to do that your firstly need to download either the [Client Version](https://www.knockoutcity.com/private-server-edition#section-download)
or the [Server only Version](https://www.knockoutcity.com/private-server-edition#section-download).

After you have downloaded the files there should be a `data.zip` in the Server folder.

:::note[Did you know?]
This is not an odenary zip file but rather a <Link href='knockoutcity-reference/vzip/overview'>`VZip`</Link>
:::

In order to extract the files from the `data.zip` you need a special script to
convert it into a real `.zip` file. This script can be found on [GitHub]().
Place the script inside the folder that contains the `data.zip` file and run the
following in your Terminal:

```bash
python3 vheader-strip.py data.zip
```

This should create a new file called `data-stripped.zip`. Now you can extract
the `.zip` file with the tool of your choice.

## Overwritting files

:::note
This is only needed for local testing. Once mod support is integrated into the
launcher mod creating will be different!
:::

In order to overwrite game files you need to create an `out` folder where the
`.exe` of the game is located. Also create an empty file called `.viper_root` in the same folder. Place the files you want to overwrite into the
`out` folder with the same sub-folder structure as the game itself. Also make
sure to overwrite the `.package_list` file that references the file you like to
overwrite as well as update the reference to `/out/...`.
