<WorkInProgressAside />

A List of Platform Achievements and their condition.
This has been used to award Achievements on `Origin`, `Epic`, `Steam` or `XBox` once certain contracts have been completed.  
_(Doesn't really look useful to modding but listed for completeness)_

## Structure

<VJsonHintAside />

```typescript
type Achievement = {
  achievement_id: number;
  contract: GUID;
};

type AchievementList = {
  /**
   * The GUID of the Object.
   */
  $guid: GUID;
  /**
   * The name of the Object.
   */
  $name?: string;
  /**
   * The VTable reference
   */
  vtable: GUID;
  /**
   * The path to the file this Object is located in.
   *
   * Example: /data/catch/achievements/origin.achievement_list
   */
  path: `${string}.achievement_list`;
  /**
   * A List of Achievements for the specific platform.
   */
  achievements: Achievement[];
  /**
   * ???
   *
   * Example: 8f59a2be-3fa7-4b1e-80f5-3be38d16ee90
