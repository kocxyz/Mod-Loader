In this section we will talk about the custom `VJson` format [Knockout City](https://www.knockoutcity.com/)
uses for its items, behaviour, layouts, and much more. It is a vital part to be
able to understand and modify the game.

## General Structure

:::note
This is the generic structure all files in the VJson format should follow.
Depending on the concrete file type additional fields can be required. Please
check the reference for the specific file type for more information!
:::

```typescript
/**
 * Each GUID is contained of 4 Segments with length 8, seperated by a '-'.
 * Each character in the GUID is in Base 16 (0-9, A-F)
 *
 * Examples:
 * 00000000-00000000-00000000-00000000
 * ABCDEF12-34567890-00000000-00000000
 */
type GUID = `${string}-${string}-${string}-${string}`;

type ExportedObject = {
  /**
   * The GUID of the Object.
   */
  $guid: GUID;
  /**
   * The name of the Object.
   */
  $name?: string;
  /**
   * The VTable reference.
   */
  vtable: GUID;
  /**
   * The path to the file this Object is located in.
   */
  path: string;

  // More depending on the specific Object variant
  // ...
};

type Segment = {
  /**
   * List of exported objects
   */
  exported_objects: ExportedObject[];
  /**
   * The name of the Segment
   */
  name: string;
  /**
   * ???
   */
  size: number;
  /**
   * Bit alignment???
   */
  alignment: 8;
};

type VJSON = {
  /**
   * A List of segments.
   */
  segments: Segment[];
  /**
   * The VTable reference.
   */
  vtable: GUID;
  /**
   * The specification verion of VJson.
   */
  version: 'vjson-1';
  /**
   * A List of GUIDs that should be imported / are referenced in the file.
   *
   * Note: Can only contain GUIDs that are exported by other files.
   */
  imports: GUID[];
  /**
   * A List of GUIDs that are exported for other files to use.
   *
   * Assumption: Only GUIDs that appear under {@link segments} can be referenced
   * here.
   */
  exports: GUID[];
};
