This section will provide you with the fundamentals of creating mods for [Knockout City](https://www.knockoutcity.com/) and start you on your modding journey.

## Creating your first mod

Mods enable users to add fresh content, functionalities, or adjustments to [Knockout City](https://www.knockoutcity.com/). A mod incorporates scripts, assets and a manifest file named <Link href='mods/reference/manifest'>`manifest.yaml`</Link>. Comprehensive guidance on the specific structure can be found in the <Link href='mods/mod-structure'>Mod Structure</Link> section.

To begin, create a folder that includes the <Link href='mods/reference/manifest'>`manifest.yaml`</Link> file, which serves as the mod's root. 
Additionally, create an `index.js` file within the same folder as the entry point for the mod. To start with, let us employ a basic example:

```js
// index.js

// Include the logging module
import logging from 'logging';

logging.info('Loading mod');
```
