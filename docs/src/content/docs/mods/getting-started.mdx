This section will provide you with the fundamentals of creating mods for [Knockout City](https://www.knockoutcity.com/) and start you on your modding journey.

## Creating your first mod

:::note[Disclaimer]
[Knockout City](https://www.knockoutcity.com/) mods exclusively utilize [`JavaScript`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) for modification purposes.
The [`Mod Loader`](https://github.com/kocxyz/Mod-Loader) will evaluate mods within a <Link href='mod-loader/sandboxing'>`Sandbox`</Link> that has limited features and modules.

For better type completion and writing mods in a type-safer way it is recommended to use [`TypeScript` ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) and the provided Types.
Auto-Completion and Type-Safty with [`TypeScript` ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) will be configured in a later section.
:::

Mods enable users to add fresh content, functionalities, or adjustments to [Knockout City](https://www.knockoutcity.com/). A mod incorporates scripts, assets and a manifest file named <Link href='mods/reference/manifest'>`manifest.yaml`</Link>. Comprehensive guidance on the specific structure can be found in the <Link href='mods/mod-structure'>Mod Structure</Link> section.

### Basic structure

:::tip[Want to safe time?]
You can also use the [`knockoutcity-mod-create`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knockoutcity-mod-create) NPM Package to automatically create an example project.
Then you can skip all the manual setup and jump right into the action!

```bash
npx knockoutcity-mod-create   # npm
pnpx knockoutcity-mod-create  # pnpm
```

:::

To begin, create a folder that includes the <Link href='mods/reference/manifest'>`manifest.yaml`</Link> file, which serves as the mod's root.
Additionally, create an `index.ts` file within the same folder as the entry point for the mod. To start with, let us employ a basic example:

```js
// index.ts

// Include the logging module
import logging from 'logging';

logging.info('Loading mod');
```

### Setting up Auto-Completion

**Requirements:**

- [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org)

To enable type completion, certain configuration is necessary.
Firstly, we initiate the project by running the following command:

```bash
npm init    # npm
yarn init   # yarn
pnpm init   # pnpm
```

This should generate a `package.json` file within the directory.

Next, we aim to acquire certain types suitable for the sandbox environment. For this task, we will need to install `typescript` and the `knockoutcity-mod-loader` as a development dependency.

```bash
# npm
npm install --save-dev \
  typescript \
  knockoutcity-mod-loader

# yarn
yarn add --dev \
  typescript \
  knockoutcity-mod-loader

# pnpm
pnpm add --save-dev \
  typescript \
  knockoutcity-mod-loader
```

Next, we need to initialize TypeScript and create a `tsconfig.json` file within the directory:

```json
// tsconfig.json

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ES6",
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "target": "ES2020",
    "strict": true,
    "alwaysStrict": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "skipLibCheck": true
  },
  "include": ["src/*", "env.d.ts"]
}
```

This file specifies how to compile our mod into the required [`JavaScript`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) format.

Now create an `env.d.ts` file in the same directory with the subsequent content:

```typescript
// env.d.ts

/// <reference path="./node_modules/knockoutcity-mod-loader/types/sandbox-api.d.ts" />
```

## Testing the mod

Coming Soon.

## Shipping the mod

Firstly, we must compile our sources to [`JavaScript`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript). This can be achieved with the following command in bash:

```bash
npx tsc   # npm
yarn tsc  # yarn
pnpm tsc  # pnpm
```

We can now package it by zipping the `dist` folder together with the `manifest.yaml` file. This will allow us to easily share our mod.
