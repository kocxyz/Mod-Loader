Here's how a [Knockout City](https://www.knockoutcity.com/) Mod is organized.

## Files and directories

- `assets/*` - Your mods assets (import files, ...)
- `index.js` - Your mods entrypoint
- <Link href='mods/reference/manifest'>`manifest.yaml`</Link> - A mod manifest

### Example Mod Contents

A common Mod Structure might look like this:

<FileTree>

- assets/
  - custom_player_icon.png.import
- index.js
- <Link href='mods/reference/manifest'>manifest.yaml</Link>

</FileTree>

### `assets/`

The `assets/` directory is for files and assets that are referenced by source files. This folder can also be named dirrently but `assets` is recommended.

### `index.js`

This file is the entrypoint to your mod. It will be loaded by the mod loader. Could also be named differently or located somewhere else but the <Link href='mods/reference/manifest'>`manifest.yaml`</Link> `entrypoint` has to be changed accordingly.

### <Link href='mods/reference/manifest'>`manifest.yaml`</Link>

This file containes all neccessary information for mod loaders to load the mod successfully. Furthermore, it includes metadata information about the mod.
